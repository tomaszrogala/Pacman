# Pacman
Classic Pacman game

While writing this program I understood the object-oriented conception. 
I figured out how usefully is the Graph structure if the software requires moving the objects thru the map. 
Now I know the benefits of polimorfizm, when we have to do with a bigger group of objects with diffrent class.
